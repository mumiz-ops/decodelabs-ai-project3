# 🤖 Project 3 — AI Recommendation Logic (Tech Stack Recommender)

> **DecodeLabs Industrial Training Kit | Batch 2026**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project builds a **Content-Based Filtering** recommendation engine that maps a user's skills to the most relevant tech career paths. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to mathematically match user profiles with job roles — the same logic powering Netflix and Amazon recommendations.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Content-Based Filtering | Match user profile to item attributes |
| TF-IDF Vectorization | Convert skills to weighted numerical vectors |
| Cosine Similarity | Measure angular alignment between vectors |
| 4-Step Pipeline | Ingestion → Scoring → Sorting → Filtering |
| Cold Start Problem | Handled via explicit user skill input |

## 🔁 Project Pipeline (IPO Framework)

```
INPUT                    PROCESS                    OUTPUT
─────                    ───────                    ──────
User Skills         →    TF-IDF Vectorization  →    Top-3 Job Roles
(min. 3 skills)          Cosine Similarity          with Match Score %
```

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **15 Job Roles** as recommendation items
- **87 unique skill terms** in the vocabulary
- Roles include: Data Scientist, ML Engineer, DevOps, Cloud Architect, NLP Engineer, and more
